# ConsoleGUI
A simple console GUI written in javafx using FXML and SceneBuilder, to be used by my text-based games.


## Project Completed
Basic functionality of the console is in order, thus this mini-project is completed. I will however continue to work on it and improve the design and functionality.

I will base my design on various internet guides, forums and other sources.

My sources and inspiration:
http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/52197/console-component-in-javafx

https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/desktop-java/javafx/javafx-borderpane-example/

I will not copy any code, but use all the examples in order to inspire my own design.
