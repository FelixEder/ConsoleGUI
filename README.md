# ConsoleGUI
A simple console GUI written in java, to be used by my text-based games.

## Project completed
The console works as intended, thus this mini-project is completed.
However, there will be legacy support as I will try to implement it with
my text-based game and change the layout and design. Basic functionality
should however be completed and there for the project has officially ended.



I will base my design on various internet guides, forums and other sources.

My sources and inspiration:
http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/52197/console-component-in-javafx

https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/desktop-java/javafx/javafx-borderpane-example/


I will not copy any code, but use all the examples in order to inspire my own design.
