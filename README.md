# ConsoleGUI
A simple console GUI written in java, to be used by my text-based games.

Basic functionality of the console is in order, but I will continue to work on it and improve the design and functionality.

The goal is to create a nice looking Console-GUI in SceneBuilder and then integrate it with my text-based games. 

I will base my design on various internet guides, forums and other sources.

My sources and inspiration:
http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/52197/console-component-in-javafx

https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/desktop-java/javafx/javafx-borderpane-example/


I will not copy any code, but use all the examples in order to inspire my own design.
